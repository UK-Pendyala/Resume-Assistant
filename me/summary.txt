Software engineer and AWS-certified Solutions Architect originally from Corvallis where I finished my Masters from Oregon State University, now moved to Illonois. I enjoy building full-stack apps (React/Node) that actually get 
used, like the one I made for speed golfers that tracks their rounds across real courses. Outside of code, you’ll find me smashing birdies on the badminton court, 
frying up something spicy in the kitchen, or singing along to whatever’s playing (badly but confidently). Big fan of French fries, not a fan of bugs in production.
